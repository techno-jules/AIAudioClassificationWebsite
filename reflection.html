  <h4>MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TECHNOLOGY IS STILL NEW & UNDER EXPERIMENTATION.</h4>
  <p> Although there is a ML solution for different problems, such as creating Audiority to detect sounds for the hearing impaired, there is still much research to do about ML's overall effectiveness, and what happens if they make major errors as they are still a new technology. Most sectors do not commonly use ML as a solution yet. Basically, ML is far from perfect yet. However, if developed enough and experimented with over time, they can be a very effective solution. ML has the potential to solve many of humanity’s most critical problems and in our future society. For example, CNN models are very powerful and versatile, especially when it is accurate, small enough, and deployable to an app.

  <h4>OUR MISSION & GOALS</h4>
  <p>With Audiority, we strive to provide a free, accessible, and accurate solution for the hearing impaired community to navigate their outdoor surroundings safely. As machine learning and mobile app technology can be very powerful, we hope to provide a unique and alternative solution that can hopefully aid as many of the 430 million hearing impaired members as possible, starting with my grandma.  </p>

  <h4>FUTURE PLANS</h4>
  <p> In the future, as machine learning technology improves, grows, and becomes more widespread, I hope to see more ML solutions in many sectors and hope that my mobile app could be put on the market for consumer use. As for Audiority in particular, I hope to further train the MLSoundClassifier model to have it detect some other outdoor sounds as well. such as the engine idling sound of a car and footsteps near or behind the user. In addition, I hope to display the sound output in other common languages as well, such as in Spanish, Mandarin, and French. I also plan to partner with as many technology companies and hearing-impaired organizations as possible in order to maximize the impact of Audiority.</p>
